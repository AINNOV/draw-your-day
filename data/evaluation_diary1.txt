My mom called me drunk tonight, crying her heart out while cheering me on, and it made me think a lot. I was addicted to games, lying through my teeth since elementary school, skipping the few classes I even attended just to sneak off to PC rooms. On holidays, I’d run away from home as a middle schooler because I wasn’t allowed to go to a PC room. I smoked, cursed, threw around sexual jokes and slang from internet communities like it was nothing. Then I got into gambling—spent two years obsessing over phone betting games every single day.

Even when I got to high school, I kept at it, running schemes and hustling as if I was living a double life. I stayed up all night, slept through school, and once called my homeroom teacher a “fing bh,” completely wrecking my first year. I almost ruined my record smoking in the classroom with a friend back in middle school. By sophomore year, I became the class president but still got into screaming matches with my teacher in the faculty office, smoked constantly, hung out with the wrong crowd, skipped evening study sessions to hit PC rooms, and played pool until dawn. My junior year? Same story. I fought with my homeroom teacher again and again.

Even as an adult, I spat out filthy language and internet slang, made degrading jokes about others, and threw around sexual words like they were casual. Honestly, I don’t even know if there was a single decent thing about me back then.

Today, I made a donation. It felt like a big step, but it also brought back memories. A few days ago, I met Jaein for the first time in four years, and we laughed as they recounted my awful past. It was funny, sure, but it hurt too. At one point, I made a joke about Jiwoon, and Jaein actually thought I’d been badmouthing them all along. Hearing that, I was stunned—was it my fault for wanting people to understand me? That question clawed at me, dragging me into a pit of regret.

Still, I don’t know how else to live. If I lived differently, would life even be fun? I’ve lived recklessly, completely on my terms. But now, the weight of it all is clashing within me, and I’m honestly terrified of myself.
