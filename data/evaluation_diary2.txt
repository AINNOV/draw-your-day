Unlike in the past, when I thought personal achievement was the most important thing in the world, I’ve come to realize how precious human relationships are—especially family—ever since I finished my military service. Back then, if it wasn’t about my studies or a really close friend, I’d ignore DMs without a second thought and couldn’t care less. But now, I’ve been trying to change, little by little. It’s not like there’s any visible difference yet, but I can feel something shifting within me.

Still, in the end, I remain the same in so many ways. I’m sarcastic and cold toward my dad, act all stoic at home, yet become this lively, animated person when I’m with close friends outside. That part hasn’t changed. If anything, I’ve taken a step backward—at least I used to study hard before. These days, I’ve started gaming again, and trying my hand at ML (machine learning) made me realize just how much I’ve lost my touch. My focus has plummeted too.

I don’t know… I feel like I’m losing more and more as time goes on. There’s this song by MC Mong called The Happiest Time of My Life, and it talks about something similar. It says that even if things feel this way now, someday, I won’t look back on the past with longing. I’ve decided to trust that and keep moving forward.

There are times when I absolutely hate myself, and other times when I’m ridiculously proud of myself. I wouldn’t call it a split personality, but it always feels like there are two completely separate sides of me that can’t ever truly merge. Is it because I still lack enough real-world experience? Even after going through the military? I really don’t know.
